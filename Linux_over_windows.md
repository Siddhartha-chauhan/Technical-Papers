# Why Linux Is Preferred
- `Free and  Open source`
Linux distributions are completely free to download, use, modify, and distribute. There's no licensing fees, unlike Windows, which requires paid licenses (especially for enterprise or server editions)
- `Security and Privacy`
It also collects far less telemetry and user data than Windows, appealing to privacy-focused users.
- `Performance and Efficiency`
Linux is lightweight, uses fewer system resources (RAM, CPU, disk space), and runs smoothly on older or lower-end hardware.
- `Stability and Reliability`
Linux servers are renowned for uptime—many run for years without rebooting. It's the OS behind most web servers, supercomputers, and cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
- `Customization and Flexibility`
Anyone can take the Linux kernel, add software, and release their own version because Linux is open-source and free. This leads to hundreds of distros, each tailored to different needs.
- `Developer and Programming Tools`
Linux provides native Unix-like tools (bash, grep, ssh, etc.) that are standard in development workflows.
- `Server Dominance`
Over 90% of web servers and top supercomputers run Linux due to its stability, security, cost, and ability to run headless
